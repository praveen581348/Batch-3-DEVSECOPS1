   - Binary Notation: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111

#### 2. Binary to Decimal Conversion:
   - Binary: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111
   - Decimal: 255.255.255.255

#### 3. Subnetting:
   - Subnet: 10.2.11.32
   - Binary: 00001010.00000010.00001011.00100000

   - CIDR Notation: 10.0.0.0/16
   - Range: 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255 (256*256 addresses)

#### 2. CIDR for Subnetting:
   - Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24
     - Range: 10.0.1.0 to 10.0.1.255

     - Range: 10.0.3.0 to 10.0.3.255

# Networking Concepts:

### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It provides logically isolated sections of the AWS Cloud where you can launch resources. Key aspects of VPC include:

#### Example:

Let's create a VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16:

```plaintext
VPC: 10.0.0.0/16
```

### Subnetting:

Subnetting involves dividing a large network into smaller, manageable sub-networks or subnets. Subnets are created within a VPC and allow you to segment resources based on use case or security requirements.

#### Example:

Within the VPC, let's create two subnets:

```plaintext
Subnet 1: 10.0.1.0/24
Subnet 2: 10.0.2.0/24
```

### Security Group:

A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. It allows or denies traffic based on rules defined for the security group.

#### Example:

Create a security group for a web server allowing HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) traffic:

```plaintext
Security Group:
  - Inbound Rule: Allow traffic on port 80 (HTTP)
  - Inbound Rule: Allow traffic on port 22 (SSH)
```

### Route Table:

A Route Table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed. Each subnet in a VPC must be associated with a route table. A default route table is automatically created when you create a VPC.

#### Example:

Create a route table with a route to an internet gateway for public subnets:

```plaintext
Route Table:
  - Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
    Target: Internet Gateway
```

### Ports:

Ports are logical constructs that represent specific communication endpoints in networking. They allow different services on the same device to utilize network resources without interference.

#### Example:

Suppose you have an EC2 instance in Subnet 1 running a web server. The Security Group associated with it allows traffic on port 80 (HTTP).

```plaintext
EC2 Instance (Subnet 1):
  - IP: 10.0.1.10
  - Security Group: Allow Inbound on port 80

Access the web server at http://10.0.1.10
```
### Conclusion:

Understanding and configuring VPCs, subnets, security groups, route tables, and ports are essential for designing a secure and scalable network architecture in the cloud. The examples provided illustrate the basic configurations, but real-world scenarios may involve more complex setups and additional considerations based on specific use cases and security requirements.


## Corprorate Shell Scripts

Real-time shell scripts are commonly used in various companies to automate tasks, manage system configurations, and perform routine operations. Below are ten examples of real-time shell scripts with detailed explanations:

1. **Backup Script:**
   - **Objective:** Automate the backup of critical data.
   - **Example Script:**
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     backup_dir="/path/to/backup"
     source_dir="/data/to/backup"
     timestamp=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
     tar -czvf "$backup_dir/backup_$timestamp.tar.gz" "$source_dir"
     ```

2. **Log Rotation Script:**
   - **Objective:** Rotate and compress log files to save disk space.
   - **Example Script:**
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     log_dir="/var/log"
     find "$log_dir" -name "*.log" -exec gzip {} \;
     find "$log_dir" -name "*.gz" -mtime +7 -delete
     ```

3. **Monitoring Script:**
   - **Objective:** Check the status of critical services and alert if they are down.
   - **Example Script:**
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     services=("apache2" "mysql" "nginx")
     for service in "${services[@]}"; do
       if ! pgrep -x "$service" > /dev/null; then
         echo "$service is not running. Restarting..."
         systemctl restart "$service"
       fi
     done
     ```

4. **User Account Management Script:**
   - **Objective:** Automate user account creation and modification.
   - **Example Script:**
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     username="newuser"
     password="password123"
     useradd -m -p $(openssl passwd -1 "$password") "$username"
     ```

5. **Disk Space Monitoring Script:**
   - **Objective:** Alert when disk space crosses a certain threshold.
   - **Example Script:**
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     threshold=90
     current_usage=$(df -h / | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | tr -d '%')
     if [ "$current_usage" -gt "$threshold" ]; then
       echo "Disk space usage is above $threshold%. Please investigate."
     fi
     ```

6. **Database Backup Script:**
   - **Objective:** Backup a MySQL or PostgreSQL database.
   - **Example Script:**
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     db_name="mydatabase"
     username="dbuser"
     password="dbpassword"
     timestamp=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
     mysqldump -u "$username" -p"$password" "$db_name" > "backup_$timestamp.sql"
     ```

7. **File Synchronization Script:**
   - **Objective:** Synchronize files between different servers.
   - **Example Script:**
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     source_dir="/path/to/source"
     dest_server="user@remote_server:/path/to/destination"
     rsync -avz "$source_dir" "$dest_server"
     ```

8. **System Resource Usage Script:**
   - **Objective:** Monitor CPU and memory usage.
   - **Example Script:**
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     cpu_usage=$(top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d. -f1)
     mem_usage=$(free | awk '/Mem/ {print $3/$2 * 100.0}')
     echo "CPU Usage: $cpu_usage%"
     echo "Memory Usage: $mem_usage%"
     ```

9. **Automatic Software Updates Script:**
   - **Objective:** Update the system and installed packages.
   - **Example Script:**
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     apt update && apt upgrade -y
     ```

10. **Web Server Log Analysis Script:**
    - **Objective:** Analyze web server logs for important metrics.
    - **Example Script:**
      ```bash
      #!/bin/bash
      log_file="/var/log/apache2/access.log"
      total_requests=$(cat "$log_file" | wc -l)
      unique_visitors=$(awk '{print $1}' "$log_file" | sort -u | wc -l)
      echo "Total Requests: $total_requests"
      echo "Unique Visitors: $unique_visitors"
      ```

These scripts serve as examples and may need customization based on specific requirements and environments. Always ensure proper testing before deploying scripts in production environments.
